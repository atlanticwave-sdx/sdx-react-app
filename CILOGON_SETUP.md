# CILogon Configuration Issue

## Problem
The CILogon client `cilogon:/client_id/e33e29a20f84e0edd144d1e9a6e2b0` is currently configured to redirect to:
```
https://lmarinve.github.io/multi-provider-authe/auth/callback/cilogon
```

However, this GitHub Pages site doesn't exist, causing the error "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here" when CILogon tries to redirect back after authentication.

## Solution
You need to update the CILogon client configuration to use the correct redirect URI that points to your actual Spark application.

### Steps to fix:

1. **Get your current Spark application URL**
   - When running locally: `http://localhost:5000/auth/callback/cilogon`
   - When deployed on GitHub Codespaces: `https://[your-codespace-url]/auth/callback/cilogon`
   - When deployed elsewhere: `https://[your-domain]/auth/callback/cilogon`

2. **Update CILogon client registration**
   - Log in to CILogon client management
   - Find your client: `cilogon:/client_id/e33e29a20f84e0edd144d1e9a6e2b0`
   - Update the redirect URI to your actual application URL
   - Save changes

3. **Update the application configuration**
   - The current code will automatically use the correct redirect URI based on `window.location.origin`
   - No code changes needed once the CILogon client is properly configured

## Current Status
- ❌ CILogon redirect URI points to non-existent GitHub Pages site
- ✅ Application code is correctly implemented with PKCE
- ✅ Callback handling is properly set up
- ✅ Token exchange logic is working

## Next Steps
Update the CILogon client configuration with the correct redirect URI, and the authentication flow will work properly.
