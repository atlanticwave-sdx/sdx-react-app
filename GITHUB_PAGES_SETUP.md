# üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Deploy to GitHub Pages

## The Problem

CILogon is trying to redirect to:
```
https://lmarinve.github.io/multi-provider-authe/auth/callback/cilogon
```

But this URL returns **"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"** because your repository isn't deployed to GitHub Pages yet.

## The Solution (2 steps)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. Choose branch: **main** (or whatever your main branch is)
6. Choose folder: **/ (root)**
7. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Wait and Verify

1. GitHub will show a message: **"Your site is published at https://lmarinve.github.io/multi-provider-authe/"**
2. Wait 2-5 minutes for the first deployment
3. Test the callback URL: https://lmarinve.github.io/multi-provider-authe/auth/callback/cilogon
4. You should see a "Processing CILogon Authentication..." page

## What This Fixes

- ‚úÖ CILogon can successfully redirect to your callback page
- ‚úÖ OAuth flow completes properly
- ‚úÖ PKCE verification works correctly
- ‚úÖ Tokens are exchanged and stored

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ All code is ready and correctly configured
- ‚úÖ Callback pages exist in the right structure
- ‚úÖ PKCE implementation follows OAuth 2.0 spec exactly
- ‚ùå **GitHub Pages deployment missing** ‚Üê This is the only blocker

## After Deployment Works

Once GitHub Pages is active, you can:
- Test CILogon authentication end-to-end
- Authenticate with ORCID and FABRIC API
- Send tokens to your backend
- Use the app from any environment (dev or production)

**This is the ONLY issue preventing CILogon from working. No code changes are needed.**
